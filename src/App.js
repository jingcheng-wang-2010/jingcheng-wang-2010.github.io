          <p>
            I started my career as a business support technician for Thales Australia while finishing off my Masters degree in Software Engineering. This role helped me build experience in business management using Microsoft SharePoint, and allowed me to familiarise with other departments as my department supported their work processes. After I finished my Masters and proceeded to PHD studies, I encountered an opportunity to join in a start-up, an Australian Chinese media company. It allowed me to make use of my fluency in English and Chinese, my knowledge in web design and social media, and gain insight on clients and partners from various industries that we work with.
